# Plansync
A productivity web-app that helps people empty their minds out of their tasks and routines during a period, and schedules it for them.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**

- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, ShadcnUI
- **API**: Nest.js
- **Database**: Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase
- **Planning Service**: Golang

It started when I wanted to convert the thinking process I go through when I wanted to study multiple subjects when I was at uni. I wrote an algorithm that automates it, in javascript at first. Then, I tried to build a mobile app that utilizes it, in React Native, but I did not like it a lot. At this point, I had already rewrote it in TypeScript. After like 2 years, I learned Go. I wanted to apply my knowledge and get better, so I thought of rewriting my algorithm in Go. I did it, and here I got the idea of Plansync. Same app, but with new interface and a better tech stack. I built a Nest.js api that interfaces the Go algorithm and adds the logic for CRUDS with the database, so I can have users that can generate, edit and monitor plans. API and Go service communicate through gRPC. I built a UI to deal with the backend and authenticated both using supabase auth. Supabase here is not a full BaaS, but it's used as a database and Auth in a decoupled way that I can easily replace one or both of them. 

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

- The algorithm itself can be optimized in terms of time & memory complexity.
- Adding feature to export plan to google calendar by specifying dates.

## Lessons Learned:

- Practicing a new language: Go, and its great features (goroutines, locks, functional programming style ...etc)
- Connecting services with gRPC and dealing with proto buffers.
- Utilizing AI agents for rapid development, providing them Specs and tasks to help building features.
Actually, 80% of code in this project was generated by multiple AI agents (Zed AI, Copilot, Augment Code).
